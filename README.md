# Simple Hotel Booking (Demo)

A small React + Vite demo app that implements a basic hotel search, listing, details, booking flow and localStorage-based bookings list.

How to run:

```powershell
cd simple-booking
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:
- This is an in-memory / localStorage demo (no backend required).
- Dates are basic HTML date inputs and validated on the search form.
